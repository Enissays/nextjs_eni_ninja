This is my first [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)).

At the moment, this website contains a website inspired from my old website enis.ninja, except this website main target is to use as much as I can Next.js/React's potential. (Kind of like a workshop) 

I'll update this README each time I add a new feature, so have this static website as a placeholder for now!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
